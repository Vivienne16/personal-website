It is widely believed that climate change is approaching its tipping point. Many national and local governments have set ambitious goals targeting carbon neutrality in the next few decades. Under increasing electrification of the heating and transportation sectors, the electric power sector will soon be the largest contributor to global GHG emissions. To manage the increasing demand and to eliminate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, energy systems will integrate distributed renewable and sustainable energy on a massive scale to reliably and efficiently replace fossil fuels. The challenges of the clean energy transition are apparent across multiple time scales, from the long-term planning of climate adaptative and resilient infrastructure upgrades to robust daily operations under high levels of uncertainty. My overarching research objective is to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon energy system that is reliable and efficient, by leveraging advanced modeling and algorithmic methods. To date, my work has been advancing in two major directions: one is to analyze the energy system reliability and resiliency under long-term climate change scenarios; the other is to design adaptive robust decision-making frameworks for localized integrated systems of heat and power considering multiple conflicting objectives. This work, described in more detail below, builds the foundation for a broader set of future research directions within my overarching objective to support the long-term decarbonization across the energy and other interconnected infrastructure systems.

Current Research Directions
1. Complex system modeling and spatiotemporal analysis with long-term impacts from climate change
2. Multi-objective robust decision-making framework under uncertainties
